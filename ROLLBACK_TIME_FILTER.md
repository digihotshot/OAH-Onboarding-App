# Time-Based Provider Filtering Rollback Guide

## Overview
The provider dropdown in the Booking Confirmation screen now filters providers based on the exact time slot selected (date + time), not just the date. This ensures that only providers who can service the specific time slot are shown.

## What Changed

### Before (Date-Only Filtering)
- Provider dropdown showed all providers available on the selected date
- Any provider with availability on that date appeared in the list
- Providers might have been shown even if they couldn't service the specific time slot

### After (Date + Time Filtering)
- Provider dropdown shows only providers available for the exact time slot
- Filters providers by matching the selected date AND selected time
- More accurate representation of which providers can actually service the appointment

## How to Roll Back

If you need to revert to the original date-only filtering behavior, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Feature Flag (Recommended)
Simply change the feature flag in `src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line ~93 in src/App.tsx
const FILTER_PROVIDERS_BY_TIME_SLOT = false;  // Change from true to false
```

This will restore the original behavior without any code removal.

### Option 2: Git Revert
If you want to completely undo these changes:

```bash
# Show recent commits
git log --oneline -5

# Revert the specific commit (replace COMMIT_HASH with actual hash)
git revert COMMIT_HASH
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/App.tsx**
   - Added `FILTER_PROVIDERS_BY_TIME_SLOT` feature flag (line ~93)
   - Updated `availableProvidersForSlot` logic (lines ~169-231)
   - Added conditional filtering based on feature flag

2. **src/components/BookingConfirmation.tsx**
   - Added documentation comment explaining the new behavior (lines ~17-19)

3. **ROLLBACK_TIME_FILTER.md** (this file)
   - Documentation for rolling back the feature

## Testing Considerations

### Test the New Behavior
1. Select a date with multiple providers
2. Select a specific time slot
3. Navigate to Step 5 (Booking Confirmation)
4. Verify that only providers available for that exact time are shown in dropdown

### Test Rollback
1. Set `FILTER_PROVIDERS_BY_TIME_SLOT = false`
2. Select same date/time as above
3. Navigate to Step 5
4. Verify that all providers for the date are shown (original behavior)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No providers showing in dropdown
**Possible Cause**: The selected time might not have any available providers
**Solution**: 
- Check console logs for "Centers with selected time" message
- Try selecting a different time slot
- Verify that `availableSlots` data contains the expected slot information

### Issue: Wrong providers showing
**Possible Cause**: Feature flag might not be working as expected
**Solution**:
- Verify the feature flag value in the console
- Check that the component re-rendered after changing the flag
- Clear browser cache and refresh

## Technical Details

### How It Works
The new implementation:
1. Finds slot data for the selected date from `availableSlots`
2. Filters centers that have slots matching the selected time
3. Maps matching center IDs to provider objects
4. Returns sorted list by priority

### Data Flow
```
selectedDate + selectedTime
    ↓
availableSlots.find(slot => slot.date === isoDate)
    ↓
Filter centers with matching time: center.slots.some(slot => slot.time === selectedTime)
    ↓
Map center IDs to Provider objects
    ↓
availableProvidersForSlot
    ↓
BookingConfirmation component
```
